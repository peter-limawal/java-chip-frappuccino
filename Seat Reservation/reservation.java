/*
Instructions:
- If you've ever been in a concert, you are aware that you buy tickets to be able to reserve a seat inside a stadium.
  The seat you will be on will have a specific number or code that would enable you to know exactly how far or how close you are to the stage.
- Create a simple seat reservation program
- Create a list that would store dashes '-' as a symbol that the seat is still available to take.
- Define a function that would loop over the list and print out the seats horizontally or in a 3 x 3 position. Refer to this image for reference.
- Define a second function that would check if the seats are occupied. This should check if the list contains "X" in each element,
  which is the symbol that we will use if the seat is taken that you will store in a variable.
  If the variable is equal to 9 (the total number of seats), return True (and break from the loop), and False if not.
- Create a loop that would have to (1) ask the user for the number of seat he would want to reserve, (2) print out the chairs,
(3) check if all the seats are occupied and (4) ask the user now if he/she wants to reserve again.

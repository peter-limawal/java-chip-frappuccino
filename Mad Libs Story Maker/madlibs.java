Instructions:
- "Mad Libs consist of a book that has a short story on each page with many key words replaced with blanks.
  Beneath each blank is specified a lexical or other category, such as "noun," "verb," "place," or "part of the body."
  One player asks the other players, in turn, to contribute some word for the specified type for each blank,
  but without revealing the context for that word. Finally, the completed story is read aloud.
  The result is usually comic, surreal and somewhat nonsensical."
- Create a Mad Libs style game, where the program asks the user for certain types of words,
  and then prints out a story with the words that the user inputted.
- The story doesn't have to be too long, but it should have some sort of story line.
- Tip: it's easiest to write out a quick story on a piece of paper or a word document, and then go back through and see which words the user should be able to change.
  ~ Subgoals:
  ~ If the user has to put in a name, change the first letter to a capital letter.
  ~ Change the word "a" to "an" when the next word in the sentence begins with a vowel.

Once, there lived a bear named James. He stayed with his owners, Mr. and Mrs. Richards. They pampered James like a boss.
However, James loved eating polyester clothes and his master and mistress smelled him for doing so.
One morning, Mr. and Mrs. Richards had to go to the school. Before leaving, they put Mr. Richards' favourite polyester shirt on the clothesline.
'James, don't eat the shirt ,' warned the Richards. Once the Richards left, it began to pour heavily.
'Oh, the shirt is getting wet! I must pull it down,' thought James. However, even before he knew it, he was eating the shirt.
When the rains stopped, James realised what he had done. 'Oh no,' he thought, 'this time they will throw me out of the house!'
He decided to keep quiet about it. When the Richards returned, Mr. Richards asked, 'Has the wind blown away my shirt?'
James promptly nodded. However, Mrs. Richards noticed a strand of polyester sticking against James' chin.
'Why! It's the shirt's polyester,' screamed Mrs. Richards. 'So you're the culprit,' confirmed Mr. Richards.
Poor James had to go without his lunch and dinner. He swore never to eat polyester again.

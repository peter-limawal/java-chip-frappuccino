/*
Instructions:
- Define a function that allows the user to find the value of the nth term in the sequence.
- To make sure you've written your function correctly, test the first 10 numbers of the sequence.
- You can assume either that the first two terms are 0 and 1 or that they are both 1.
- There are two methods you can employ to solve the problem. One way is to solve it using a loop and the other way is to use recursion.
- Try implementing a solution using both methods.
